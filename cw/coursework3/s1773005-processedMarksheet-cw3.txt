COMMENTS:

Abstract 
Good.

Introduction/Objectives 
Some citations for section 1 (dataset).
The Objectives only mentions creating a baseline, but does not explain what things have to be achieved for the project to be a success. They are implicit in section 1, however.
The research question seems to be to produce a good model.


Data set and task 
The data parameters could use some explanation, and the stats for training/validationtest are not given.


Methodology
There is a choice here to describe things that are used in this Coursework, rather than analyse technologies that will be studied. In light of this, I will be moving points from here to the experiments.
RNNs should have been described in this coursework however, since you need to draw conclusions about why they might perform better at the task.



Experiments 
There are detailed and well presented baseline experiments.



Interim conclusions 
The conclusions suffer from the lack of description of RNNs, and re as a result quite poor.


Plan
There is no description of a plan, other than that RNNs will be tried.
