COMMENTS:
You have no references.. 

Abstract: 
No abstract. -5 points. 

Introduction: 
Try to give more motivation and introduction to your research question. 
Introduction is not the place for technical details.

Description of activation functions: 
Good, but next time use the references for the papers introducing the activation functions. 

Activation function experiments:  
What learining rate did you use?
How did you measure the runtime? 

You seem to be reporting results based on a single opitmization run. Do you think these results are reliable? 

Deep neural network experiments:  

Again, you use a single optimization run. Could these results be due to chance? 

Conclusions: 
You report results, but don't try to explain them.
