COMMENTS:


Abstract
Good.


Introduction & Objectives 
There is no real motivation given.Instead you go straight into describing the dataset.
Objectives are clearly given.
(Define acronyms in the main text rather than the abstract, where you are better of using whole words, unless there is a repetition).



Methodology & Experiments 
Better to explain the methodology in terms of models, architectures and algorithms rather than as tensorflow methods.
Explain the data and task in more detail. "Segment feature"?
The convolutional networks need more explanation - what is the input data representation?  does it make sense to define convolutions over this representation?  what structure can be learned?
There is little discussion of the results, which makes the sequence of graphs harder to interpret.
Figures could be larger.

Related work 
Good in that it focuses on the task, but it should extend beyond the boundaries of the current dataset.

Conclusions 
Fair, but I would have wanted more insight.
